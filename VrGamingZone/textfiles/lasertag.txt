Laser tag is almost always played at an indoor arena that is designed specifically for laser tag. There will be obstacles for cover, and the lights will be dimmed to make the game more intense. When in-game, play smart by working as a team to ensure total victory. Set up the game by splitting into 2 to 4 teams. Put on your tactical vest and grab a laser gun to start the game.
